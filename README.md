#Milestone Project 1
Welcome USER_NAME,

In this document I will explain the approach and reason behind the website called MetaMinded. The purpose of this website is to give the user an introduction of the Metaverse: a first glance of what it is, and can be. To accomplish this the website includes a definition, an introduction video, recommended books, and a sign up page to get an update whenever there is a new book available. The user in mind is someone that does not know anything about the Metaverse and start learning more about it. This website is responsive and thus can be accessed via desktop, tablet and mobile phone.

## User Experience (UX)
**User stories (first time, returning, frequent)**
The user stories that are at the base of this website are devided into three categories:

First time users
* As a first time user I want to understand what this website is about.
* As a first time user I want to be able to navigate through the site to see the different content.
* As a first time user I want to be able to learn more about this website, its activities and goals by reviewing its social media.

Returning users
* As a returning user I want to gain more knowledge of the Metaverse at a basic level.
* As a returning user I want to know how I can gain more knowledge about the Metaverse when leaving this website.
* As a returning user I want to know how I can get in touch with the person behind this website to ask questions.

Frequent users
* As a frequent user I want to see if any new books are added to the website by either visiting the website or sign up for updates.


**Design**
The design of the website is kept minimalistic to ensure the focus went to the content and the artistic images to show how the Metaverse can look like. A lot of people might think it will look like a video game, so the purpose of these large and artistic images is to show them differently.

The colors used for the website are black, white, and a darkish purple (#865f7b).

**Features**

## Technologies Used
**Languages Used**
* HTML5
* CSS

## Frameworks, Libraries & Programs Used
* Hover.css: I used hover to give the user feedback when hovering over the menu items and buttons.
* Google Fonts: I used Google Fonts to include two types of fonts: Playfair Display and Sources Sans Pro.
* Font Awesome: I used Font Awesome for icons which are used on the Metaverse Characteristic section on index.html.

* UnSplash.io: I used Unsplash.io as image library. All images are from the artis Mo.

## Testing
The W3C Markup Validator and W3C CCS Validator Services were used to validate every page of the project to ensure there were no syntax errors in the project.

**Testing the User Stories from User Experience (UX) section**
First time users
* As a first time user I want to understand what this website is about: upon entering the site the user immediately sees the introduction text on the hero image introducing the topic.
* As a first time user I want to be able to navigate through the site to see the different content: the user has the ability to use the navigation menu, scroll down, use the site map in the footer, or the call to action button.
* As a first time user I want to be able to learn more about this website, its activities and goals by reviewing its social media: the user can access the social media accounts via the links in the footer.

Returning users
* As a returning user I want to gain more knowledge of the Metaverse at a basic level: the user is presented with a definition, introduction video, characteristics section and book suggestions to gain more knowledge about the Metaverse.
* As a returning user I want to know how I can gain more knowledge about the Metaverse when leaving this website: the user is presented with a book selection which he can read after leaving the site, and a sign up page to get updates about additional information.
* As a returning user I want to know how I can get in touch with the person behind this website to ask questions: the user can see the contact information of the website creator in the footer.

Frequent users
* As a frequent user I want to see if any new books are added to the website by either visiting the website or sign up for updates: the user can give his contact information on the sign up page to get additional information about newly released books.


**Bugs found and solved**
* Positioning library: during testing my website I found that my book library was not responsive. That's why I changed it from a table to a Grid, which allowed me to make it responsive.
* Responsiveness iframe: during testing my website I found that the iframe (introduction video) was not responsives. I researched online and found out how to make it responsive. However, then it covered the whole page. I want it to be a max height and width but also to be responsive. That is why I have kept the max height and width in the iframe declaration (in HTML) and put the responsiveness code in the media queries.
* Responsiveness book library: after testing my code it became clear that my book library was not responsing to my responsiveness code. After a tutor session it became clear I needed to adjusted grid-template-columns in my media queries to grid-auto-flow.
* Aria-labels: After putting my code in the W3C HTML validator I got a warning regarding misuse of ARIA labels. I removed them in my background images' div, which solved the issue.

## Deployment
**GitHub Pages**
The project was deployed to GitHub Pages using the following steps:
1. I pushed my final code via the terminal after finishing the project.
2. I navigated on GitHub to 'Settings'
3. After Settings I navigated to GitHub Pages
4. There I selected 'Deploy from Branch'
5. Then I selected 'Main/(root)' branch

## Credits
**Code**
* Some of the code is based on the examples of the Love Running Project
* The code for making my iframe responsives I got from StackOverflow [Making iframe Responsive](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/17838607/making-an-iframe-responsive)

**Content**
* The definition of the Metaverse is based on the Metaverse Wikipedia site

**Media**
* All images come from UnSplash.io from the artist Mo.

**Acknowledgements**
